Miokyo is a java applet inspired by the popular web-based online game, [Agar.io](http://agar.io/).
Miokyo was created with a partner for our 12th grade computer science class. 
It demonstrates the use of basic object oriented programming, collision detection, and graphics. 

The objective of Miokyo is absorb cells in order to grow in size, to reach the goal of 200.
You control a cell which will follow your mouse's direction. Cells randomly spawn across the screen, and continually spawn
as they are eaten. There are enemy CPU's that will also spawn (every time the red bar fills up), and will travel 
in a randomly changing direction absorbing everything in their path. Colliding with an enemy CPU will cause you to 
lose half of your size, slowing down your progress. As the game progresses it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid the CPU's 
they continue to spawn and take up majority of the screen, making Miokyo extremely fast paced.
